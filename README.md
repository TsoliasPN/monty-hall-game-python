# Monty Hall Game (Python)

This repository contains a Python program that simulates the Monty Hall Game, a popular probability puzzle in which a contestant is presented with three doors, behind one of which is a prize, and must choose which door to open in order to win the prize. After the contestant has made their initial choice, the host of the game show opens one of the other two doors to reveal that it does not contain the prize, and then offers the contestant the opportunity to switch their choice to the remaining door. The puzzle asks: should the contestant switch their choice, or stick with their initial selection?

This program provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to play the Monty Hall Game and see the probabilities of winning when switching or staying with their initial choice. The GUI displays three doors, each labeled with a number, and allows the user to click on a door to make their initial choice. After the user has made their initial choice, the program reveals one of the other doors that does not contain the prize, and then displays buttons labeled "Switch" and "Stay" to allow the user to make their decision. The program then shows the probability of winning if the user switches or stays with their initial choice, and updates the winning percentages as the game progresses.
